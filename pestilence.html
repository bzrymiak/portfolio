                        <p>Pestilence is a 2D retro-style tile-based action adventure game that revolves around a plagued town, which the player must save by collecting three stars hidden around the map. The player must solve the maze, collect 50 coins, and defeat 20 enemies in order to collect all the stars and unlock a special area, wherein the stars fall into place on the ground and the screen fades to white, completing a ritual and saving the town from its disease. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/bzrymiak/full/LsRLSwip8" target="_blank">Play it for yourself</a>!</p>

                        <p>My goal for this project was to create something that I would enjoy playing, which is where I drew inspiration from games like Hollow Knight and Stardew Valley. More than anything, I was set on this game having multiple distinct areas to explore and somewhat of a story for the player to piece together. </p>

                        <h4>Outcome</h4>
                        <p>For this project, I had clear ambitions for an explorable adventure game with assets that I would make myself. To achieve this, I had to manage my time effectively to balance the programming and art creation of the game, both of which were unexpectedly time consuming due to my inexperience. For this reason, I ended up having to scale back my gameplay ideas significantly.</p>

                        <p>As an end result, Pestilence has 4 unique areas with their own events and features, including a maze and final room that blends into a cutscene. To reach most areas, the player will need to collect keys in order to unlock gates, however the final room is locked until the moment the player collects 3 stars that are hidden around the map. One star is collected by defeating a certain number of enemies, some of which will fly towards the player if they enter their line of sight.</p>

                        <h4>Takeaways</h4>
                        <p>My biggest lesson learned from this project was to perform regular user testing. I became blind to the routine of the game as I played it, and having fresh eyes to play through it illuminated a lot when it came to difficulty, accessibility, and general user enjoyment. In the future, I plan on emphasizing accessibility from the start in order to avoid issues I encountered with how the game and its story were understood by players.</p>
